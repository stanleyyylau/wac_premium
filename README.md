## AccountingJS

### Part1

Started from this article ``http://stackoverflow.com/questions/149055/how-can-i-format-numbers-as-money-in-javascript``

Make sure you

+ Read the docs
+ Run the code
+ Play with the app to see what the code is supposed to do
+ Think about how the code might be implemented
+ Get the code into an editor


### Part2

Use this cheatsheet ``https://github.com/stanleyyylau/cheatsheet-js``

Take documentation seriously, treat it like you're reading code!!!!!!
Don't always trust the docs, run the code, modify the arguments and see how it works!!! very the docs with the actual code

The quality of the writing for docs is usually not very good, be independent, and not rely on the docs

+ Check how the demo code work(feed different arguments, try to break it)
+ Change min to development version
